# Licode Ruby SDK

The Licode gem is designed to help you interface with the Licode platform via server side code.
It is influenced by the original `nuveClient_ruby` found in the ging/licode repo but isn't a gem and isn't easy to include in your projects.

This also will be more up to date and testable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'licode'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install licode

## Usage



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
